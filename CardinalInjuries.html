                <h3>Promising talent on the team</h3>
                <P>
                    The season started with hight expectations as the front office added Arenado and resigned veterans Molina and Wainwright.  To go with 
                    those veterans, the team also has promising young players patroling the outfield in O'Neil, Bader, and Carlson.  
                </p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Harrison Bader</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Currently on the IL.  When playing, typically has one of the fastest sprint times
                        in all of baseball.  Covers a lot of ground in the outfield.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Tyler O'Neil</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Currently has the most homeruns on the team.  He can also be found on the fastest
                        sprint times in baseball list.  Has some of the longest homeruns hit this year in all of 
                        baseball.

                <h3>Injuries have wrecked havoc</h3>
                <p>
                    Pitching was expected to be a strong point for the team.  Unfortunately, two starters joined Hudson on the injured list before the season started.
                    All of the following have spent time on the IL.
